Here in this binary search tree file I have created a class for BST wherein there are various functions of it that is used to create this data structure.
When we talk about tree it is a type of hierarchical data structure where there is no cycle present.
But we cannot directly implement tree in coding as it will be very much difficult to have a prior knowledge of how many child a node will have.
So for that we introduce Binary tree in which each node can have atmost two child of every node.
But there is no specific rule for insertion in binary tree which will create a lot of complications.
So we have a special version of BT called Binary search Tree(BST) which has specific rule for insertion 
where values of each node in left subtree will be less than the root node and values of each node in right subtree is greater than the value if root node.
